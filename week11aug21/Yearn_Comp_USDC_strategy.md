## 2. Returns on the ‘Generic Leverage Compound Farm’ strategy

The ‘Generic Leverage Compound Farm' is a USDC yVault strategy that accepts USDC deposits and transfers them to the Compound money market, where they generate interest. The approach is a leveraged one that utilises dYdX's flash loans. USDC deposits are accepted by the yVault, which is then allocated to the strategy . We'll look into how the strategy works and how yield is generated in detail.

The Compound money market provides yield in two different forms

* Users supply assets to the market, which are exchanged for cTokens for the equivalent amount. cTokens are yield bearing tokens, which means that the yield is included to the token exchange rate, and users can collect the yield for the time period held by simply exchanging the tokens.
* Compound governance token is also provided as a reward.
